The deep concussion from the explosive breaching charge shattered the dark night it was a hell of a wake uo call for the occupants inside the house as the door blow in, and well armed men with weapons ready for a flight entered the house. the humvees pushed forward across the bridge, down the narrow street wide enough only for a single vechicle, and came to a stop in security position around the target buliding each vechicle ,and came to a stop in security position around the target buliding each vechicles turret contained a SEAL manning a heavy machine gun, ready to provide fire support if things went sideways, i was the ground force commander the senior SEAL in charge of this operation. I had just stepped out of the command vehicle and onto the street near the target buliding when suddenly some one yelled, meaning it was our EOD operation nearby who has seen the squirter, someone fleeing the target buliding, perhaps it was the terrorist himself or someone with information on his where abouts we could allow him to escape. The EOD operator and i were the only ones inposition to pursure him, so we sprinted after the man, we chased him down a narrow alleyway, around a group of bulidings, and down another dark the street where our humavess were parked finally we cought up to him a mkiddle aged iraqi man in a traditional arabic robe or dishdasha. as we were trained he was quickly forced to the ground and his hands controlled those hands didn't possed a weapon, but he might have a grenade in his pocket or, worse, be wearing an explosive suicide belt under the clothing anyone associated with such a high level terrorist might have such deadly devices, and we couldn't assume otherwise just to be sure, he had to be searched quickly.
