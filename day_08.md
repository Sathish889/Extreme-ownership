 I became keenly aware that we all alone in the world, totally separated from our unit. The rest of out SEAL assalut force didn't known where we were. There hadn't been time to notify them, wasn't even sure exactly where we were located relevent to their position. All around us were darkend windows and rooftops of uncleared buildings, where enemy fighters might be lurking preparing to attack and unleash hell on us at any second, we had to get back and link up with our toops ASAP. But even before we could cuff the man's hands and begin a pat-down search for weapons, i heard movement as i looked down the alleyway throught my night vision googles, suddenly seven or eight men rounded the corner not forty yards from us, they were heavily armed and rapidly moving towards us. For a split second, my mind questioned what my eyes where seeing, but there it was the unmistakeable outlines of AK-47 rifles, an RPG-7 shoulder- fired rockets, and at least one belt-fed machine gun, they weren't there to shake our hands. These were armed enemy fighters maneuvering to attack. Now the two of us the EOD operator and i were in a hell of tight spot the subdued iraqi man and possible terrorist we were holding had not yet been searched, a situation that carried huge risks we needed to fall back and link up with the rest of our force now with a large enemy force maneuving on us with heavier firepower, the two of us were outnumbered and out gunned. Finally, i desperatley needed to resum my role as ground force commander, dispense with handling prisoners and get back to my job of commad and control for the assault force, our vechicles, and coordination with our distant supporting assets, all this had to be accomplished immediately.
