Execute without doing something, I engaged the enemy fighters moving towards us with my colt M4 rifle, hammering the first insurgent in line  carrying the RPG with three to four rounds to the chest, dead center. As he dropped, i rapidly shifted fire to the next bad guys, then to the next. The muzzle flashed and report of the rifle ammounced to all within earshot that a firefight was on. The group of enemy fighters hadn't bargained for this, they panicked and those who come, some crawled and others dragged the wounded and drying around the street cornor and out of sight as i continued to engage them, i knew i had hit at least three or four of them. Throught the rounds has been accurate and impacted the enemy fighters center of mass, the 5.56mm round was just too small to have much knock power, now the bad guys were around the cornor , some no douts dead or gravely wounded and soon to be ,  but surely those who were unscathed would regroup and attack again likely rounding up even more fighters to join their efforts. We needed to move there was no time for a complex plan nor did i have the luxury of providing specific direction to my shooting buddy, the EOD operation next to me. But we had to execute immediately having dealt with the highest priority task armed enemy fighters maneuvering to attack and with that threat at least temporarily checked, our next priority was to fall back and link up with our SEAL assault force, to do this. The EOD operation and i utlized cover and move teamwork, i provided cover fire whilke he bounded back to a position where he could cover me. Then i moved to a new position where he could cover me, then i moved to a new position back wards the rest of our team with the prisoner in tow, as soon as we reached the cover of a concrete wall in a prisoner alleyway, i kept my weapon at the ready to cover while the EOD operation conducted a quick search of the prisoner, finding no weapons, we then continued back and linked upwith our team and ones there handed off the prisoner to the designated prisoner handling team with the assault force.`
