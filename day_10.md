 I had deployed to iraq before, nut never had i been in  a sutivation like this thought combat is often depitched in movies and vidio games, this was not a movie and it certanily was no game there was heavly armed and dangerous men determine to kill american and iraqi troops were any of us to fall into there hands, we could expect to be tortured in unspeakable ways and then decapitated on vidio for all the world to see they wanted nothing more than to kill us and were willing to die by the dozen to do us. blood pumping adrenaline surging, i kwen every nanosecond counted this situvation could overwhelm the most competent leader and seasoned combat veteran, but the words of my immedate boss our task unit commander, lieutenant commander jocko willink echoed inmy head, words regularly heard during a fukll year of intensiuve training and preparation relax look around make a call, our SEAL platoon and task unit had trained extensively throught dozens of despreate, chaotic, and overwhelming situvation to prepare for just such a moment as this i understood how to implement the laws of combat that jocko had thught us cover and move simple prioritize and execute and decentralized command, the laws of combat were the key to not just surviving a dire situation such as this but actu;lay thriving enavling us to totally dominated the enemy and win they guided my next move prioritize of all the pressing task at hand if i didn't first handle the armed enemy fighters bearing down on us within the nest few seconds nothing else would matter we would be dead, worse the enemy fighters would continu their attack and might kill more of our SEAL assault force, this was my hightest priorit
